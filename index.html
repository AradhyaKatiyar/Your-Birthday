    <h2>🎉 Happy 21st Birthday, my person 🎉</h2>
    <p>
      We’ve laughed, cried, fought, and grown — and through it all, my trust in you has only deepened. You’re not just someone I love, you’re someone I believe in.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bond we share — it’s built on honesty, friendship, and that kind of rare connection people search for their whole lives. Even across the distance, you're the most present part of my day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's to your strength, your kindness, and to the light you bring into my world. Happy 21st, my love. The world is lucky to have you — and I’m even luckier. 💖
    </p>
